## TN-State-Parks-and-Population
An evaluation of state park usage and population over time.

As a lifelong resident of Nashville I have been privileged to enjoy the Tennessee State Park system. Visiting our state parks is a hobby of mine, so during the 2020 global pandemic as I sought out our state parks for a safe socially distanced outing, I could not help but notice the increased park guests.

My popular park encounters left me with a few questions to evaluate:
* What parks are most and least popular?
* What are the features in these parks that could contribute to these rankings?
* Were there actually more guests to Tennessee's parks in recent years?
* Were the parks slowly becoming more popular in relation to Tennessee's population growth or could the attendance be attributed to COVID-19 regulations?

Many thanks to the TN Department of Environment and Conservation as well as the Tennessee State Parks Department.
